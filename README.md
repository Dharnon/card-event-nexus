## Overview

This repository powers a modern, responsive web application built with Vite, TypeScript, React, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui. It provides a flexible foundation for rapid development, testing, and deployment.

## Tech Stack

* **Vite**: Blazing-fast development server and build tool
* **TypeScript**: Statically-typed JavaScript for maintainable code
* **React**: Component-driven user interface library
* **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling framework
* **shadcn/ui**: Accessible, customizable React component library

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to run the project locally and start building.

### Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16+)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v8+)
* [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (optional, for Node version management)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Move into the project directory
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Development

```bash
# Start the development server with live reload
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser. Changes to the source code will trigger automatic reloads.

## Editing & Collaboration

You can edit this project through multiple workflows:

**1. Local Development**

* Clone the repository as described in [Installation](#installation).
* Open the code in your preferred IDE (e.g., VS Code).
* Develop, test, and commit changes normally.
* Push updates to the main branch or create feature branches for pull requests.

**2. GitHub Web Interface**

* Navigate to any file in the GitHub repository.
* Click the pencil icon to open the in-browser editor.
* After editing, provide a commit message and push changes directly.

**3. GitHub Codespaces**

* From the repository main page, click **Code > Codespaces > New codespace**.
* Edit and test in the cloud environment without local setup.

## Deployment

To deploy the application, follow your preferred hosting provider’s workflow. For a quick static deploy:

```bash
# Build the production bundle
npm run build

# Preview the production build locally
npm run preview
```

Deploy the contents of the `dist` directory to any static hosting service (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages).

## Custom Domain

To add a custom domain:

1. Configure your DNS provider to point a CNAME or A record to your hosting provider.
2. In your hosting dashboard, add the custom domain under domain settings.
3. Enable HTTPS—most providers offer automatic certificates.

See your hosting platform’s documentation for detailed steps.
